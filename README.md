# HAC Projects 

Welcome to the HAC (Hardware Accelerated Computing) Projects repository!

--- 
## Overview

This repository contains multiple projects focused on hardware-accelerated image processing and computation, including both CUDA (GPU) and HLS (FPGA) implementations.

---

## Project Structure

- **Cuda/**  
  Projects and exercises using NVIDIA CUDA for GPU-accelerated image processing.
  - `Cuda.ipynb` – Step-by-step instructions for running CUDA projects.
  - `CudaEindoefening/src/` – Final CUDA exercise, including source code and image assets.
  - `EindOefeningInC/` - Same exercise but written in standard C.

---

- **HLS/**  
  Projects using High-Level Synthesis (HLS) for FPGA-based image processing.
  - `HLS.ipynb` – Step-by-step instructions for running HLS projects.
  - `HLS_Convolution/` – HLS exercises, testbenches, and related files.
  - `HLS_Poolings/` – HLS exercises, testbenches, and related files.
