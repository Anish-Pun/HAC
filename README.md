# HAC Projects 

Welcome to the HAC (Hardware Accelerated Computing) Projects repository!

--- 
## Overview

This repository contains multiple projects focused on hardware-accelerated image processing and computation, including both CUDA (GPU) and HLS (FPGA) implementations.

## Project Structure

- **Cuda/**  
  Projects and exercises using NVIDIA CUDA for GPU-accelerated image processing.
  - `INSTRUCTIONS.md` – Step-by-step instructions for running CUDA projects.
  - `EindOefening/` – Final CUDA exercise, including source code and image assets.

- **HLS/**  
  Projects using High-Level Synthesis (HLS) for FPGA-based image processing.
  - `HLSEindoefening/` – HLS exercises, testbenches, and related files.
